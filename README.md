Numerical-Libraries
===================

Demonstrating various numerical C++ libraries. The idea here will be for participants to choose a library, spend 
about a week learning how to do some stuff in it (vectors, matrices, solvers, integration?), and we'll have a day 
of short presentations where we discuss what we've learned and compare the syntax from different libraries.

Some libraries to condiser:

Boost / odeint
GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
Eigen
and more on a good list at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numerical_libraries#C.2B.2B
